  abstract  = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot achieve
               accurate positioning and navigation in the indoor
               environment. Therefore, efficient indoor positioning
               technology has become a very active research topic. Bluetooth
               beacon positioning is one of the most widely used
               technologies. Because of the time-varying characteristics of
               the Bluetooth received signal strength indication (RSSI),
               traditional positioning algorithms have large ranging errors
               because they use fixed path loss models. In this paper, we
               propose an RSSI real-time correction method based on
               Bluetooth gateway which is used to detect the RSSI
               fluctuations of surrounding Bluetooth nodes and upload them
               to the cloud server. The terminal to be located collects the
               RSSIs of surrounding Bluetooth nodes, and then adjusts them
               by the RSSI fluctuation information stored on the server in
               real-time. The adjusted RSSIs can be used for calculation and
               achieve smaller positioning error. Moreover, it is difficult
               to accurately fit the RSSI distance model with the
               logarithmic distance loss model due to the complex
               electromagnetic environment in the room. Therefore, the back
               propagation neural network optimized by particle swarm
               optimization (PSO-BPNN) is used to train the RSSI distance
               model to reduce the positioning error. The experiment shows
               that the proposed method has better positioning accuracy than
               the traditional method.},
